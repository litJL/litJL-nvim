# litJL's nvim coding envrionment

This is the coding environment I use for coding anything efficiently.

It's mostly meant just as a backup in the case that my laptop goes up in flames.

I am still learning how to use nvim effectively so this is by no means an optimal setup.

## Requires:

- Python3
- NodeJS (v16 if copilot is supposed to work)
- probably some other things that I missed
